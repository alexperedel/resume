                    {`Hi Travelex Team,

Thanks for taking the time to read my application. I'm genuinely interested in joining your team.

I’ve worked in customer-facing retail roles, so I understand how important it is to create a smooth and positive experience for every person who walks in. I’m someone who enjoys helping others, staying organized, and keeping the day running efficiently.

My background in programming has trained me to think logically, solve problems calmly, and pay close attention to detail. These are skills I bring to any role—helping me learn quickly, adapt to new situations, and collaborate with a team.

I’m not just looking for a job — I’m looking for a place to grow, contribute, and be part of something meaningful. I see Travelex as more than a company — It’s something travelers around the world rely on every day, and I’d be proud to play even a small part in that.

Thanks again for considering me. I’d welcome the chance to talk more about how I can contribute and support your team.

Warm regards,
Alex Peredelskii`}

                    {`I’m interested in Travelex because it plays a big part in helping people feel ready and comfortable when they travel. I like the idea of being part of a team that supports customers at such an important moment — whether they’re going on a holiday or visiting family. It’s not just about exchanging money — it’s about making things easy and giving people peace of mind. That’s something I’d really enjoy being part of.`}
